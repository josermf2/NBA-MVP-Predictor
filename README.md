# NBA MVP Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the NBA season using web scraping techniques with Python, along with data manipulation and analysis. The project collects data from [basketball-reference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) for MVPs, team standings, and player statistics. The collected data is then processed to create CSV files for further analysis and prediction.
